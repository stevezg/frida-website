          Much of my childhood, in the small mountain town of Michoacan Mexico,
          was in the kitchen of my parent's restaurant called Argelia's
          Senaduria. The typical restaurant in my area was called a Senaduria
          (meaning Dinner Time) and was run out of the home. Ours was a place in
          our house where we opened a large door to reveal our small dining area
          which would soon fill with local customers.

          My parents were popular in our home town. My mother and father,
          Argelia and Alberto, always believed that serving better quality food
          would help make you a successful person and would always bring good
          things back. Their food was made from authentic Mexican recipes with
          authentic Mexican flavors. Their commitment in the kitchen, even down
          to the scrambled eggs, was to make the best food they could.

          We welcome you to El Pollo Rico where we hope to bring you a true
          taste of authentic Mexican flavors served with a large portion of
          hometown hospitality.
